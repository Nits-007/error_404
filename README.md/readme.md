VAYU : (a work towards clean air)

DESCRIPTION

This project is dedicated to wildlife and nature .
It is an carbon footprint calculator which calculates the emmission of 
carbon to the environment on daily basis by us humans.

USE OF PROJECT

This website takes the input from its user about its daily work like his/her
car uses , transport , livestock , household and calculates the carbon emitted 
on using these things.

This website has a beautiful framed backend work made using " python library- 'flask' "
and the database used in it is SQLite.This website helps one to keep a note of the carbon 
emission due to them to the environment. It also suggest effective measures for them to lessen 
their uses in order to decrease carbon emmission.We had many difficulties while making this 
website as of searching for all the specific engines hence we focused on calculating the 
average carbon emmission value.
However this is only a prototype we have presented here. It still have some flaws like we can not provide specific suggestions to users based on the carbon they emmit. We have also used an average value for different type of engines of vehicles which user uses in his/her day to day life.
We think that we had faced some sort of time shortage as it is our first ever hackathon and because of this we had some loose ends in our projet. 

Thanks to my team (Error 404) in helping and getting this project done , without whom this would be '
an impossible job to accomplish , my heart-felt gratitude to SAHIL KUMAR , NITIN PRATAP ,
SAHIL KUMAR , RISHAV RANJAN

we would also appriciate your inputs in our work .
